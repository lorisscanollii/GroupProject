                        <p class="text-muted">BMW is renowned for creating high-performance, efficient, and driver-oriented engines. They are often praised for their precision engineering, driving dynamics, and the "Ultimate Driving Machine" philosophy.

                            <strong>Engine Types:</strong>
                            
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Inline Engines:</strong> BMW has a long history with inline-4 and inline-6 engines, which are known for their smoothness and balance. The inline-6 engine is often a hallmark of BMW’s driving experience. These engines are renowned for their balance and smooth power delivery. BMW’s B58 (inline-6) engine found in models like the 330i and 540i is a standout for its smooth power delivery, efficiency, and strong torque characteristics.</li>
                                <li><strong>Turbocharged Engines:</strong> BMW has embraced turbocharging extensively, especially in recent years. Their turbocharged inline-4 (N20) and inline-6 engines (B58) offer excellent performance while maintaining fuel efficiency. The BMW M performance cars (like the M3 and M5) use twin-turbocharged inline-6 (S58) and V8 engines (S63), providing significant power output and responsiveness.</li>
                                <li><strong>Electric & Hybrid Engines:</strong> BMW’s i Performance and i8 electric/hybrid models use innovative hybrid and electric powertrains, blending performance and sustainability. Their hybrid models often combine electric motors with traditional gasoline engines to provide both efficiency and performance.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <strong>Key Technologies:</strong>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>TwinPower Turbo:</strong> BMW’s branding for their turbocharged engine technology that includes a combination of variable valve timing (VANOS), turbocharging, and direct fuel injection.</li>
                                <li><strong>xDrive:</strong> BMW’s all-wheel-drive system that helps improve traction and performance.</li>
                                <li><strong>M Performance:</strong> The M series models use specially tuned engines and transmission systems to deliver high performance, often featuring larger turbocharged engines and performance-tuned suspensions.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <strong>Notable Models:</strong>
                            <ul>
                                <li>BMW 3 Series (compact executive sedan)</li>
                                <li>BMW 5 Series (luxury sedan)</li>
                                <li>BMW X5 (luxury SUV)</li>

                        <h4 class="my-3">Stages</h4>
                        <p class="text-muted">Stage 1 Goal: The goal of Stage 1 is to optimize stock components without changing internal engine parts. This is often the first step in improving acceleration, throttle response, and fuel efficiency. <br> Stage 2 Goal: Stage 2 focuses on improving a car’s performance by enhancing critical components such as the turbocharger, exhaust, and fueling system. Cars tuned to Stage 2 are usually more aggressive in terms of power output but still maintain daily driveability. <br> Stage 3 Goal: Stage 3 cars are built for the highest level of performance. These cars are often used for racing or extremely high-performance applications, where the car needs to handle extreme levels of stress on the engine, transmission, and drivetrain.</p>
